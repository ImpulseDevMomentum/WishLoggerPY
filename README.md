To use the Wish bot, start by installing all the dependencies listed in `utils/imports.py`. Once that's set up, go to `utils/token.py` and paste in your bot token. You can learn more about Wish by exploring the codebase or simply by using the bot.

Wish is a public, verified bot and can be run across multiple servers.

Note: The code for Wish was made public after I decided I no longer wanted to maintain it. I will probably maintain this repository, but whether new features are added will depend on my mental health status.


There was an individual, !ja_toxly, who also paid for the VPS where Wish was hosted. However, this person does not have any rights to sell Wish for personal purposes. The entire code was written by me, and I can provide proof - I have all versions of Wish
from 1.0 to 4.0, along with website files and other content stored on my PC, cloud, USB drives, and laptop.
Wish Logger, better known as Wish, was created to offer Discord users a free, reliable logging experience. So please, do not buy Wish from them (user @1030566399283826698 - !ja_toxly ) and do not support individuals like them. Instead, you can download Wish from here and enjoy it for free!
