To use the Wish bot, start by installing all the dependencies listed in `utils/imports.py`. Once that's set up, go to `utils/token.py` and paste in your bot token. You can learn more about Wish by exploring the codebase or simply by using the bot.

Wish is a public, verified bot and can be run across multiple servers.

Note: The code for Wish was made public after I decided I no longer wanted to maintain it.
